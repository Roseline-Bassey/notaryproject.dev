## What registries are compatible with Notary?

The following registries are compatible with Notary for artifact signing and verification:

- [Azure Container Registry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/?wt.mc_id=azurelearn_inproduct_oss_notaryproject)
- [Amazon Elastic Container Registry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/what-is-ecr.html)
- [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry)
- [ORAS Distribution Registry](https://github.com/oras-project/distribution/pkgs/container/registry/64589674?tag=v1.0.0-rc.4)
- [Zot registry](https://zotregistry.io/v1.4.3/)


## JWS signature envelope

**Q: Why JWT is not used as the signature envelope format?**

**A:** JWT uses JWS compact serialization which do not support unsigned attributes. Notary signature requires support for unsigned attributes. Instead we use the *JWS JSON Serialization* representation, which supports unsigned attributes.

**Q: Why JWT `exp` and `iat` claims are not used?**

**A:** Unlike JWT which always contains a JSON payload, Notary envelope can support payloads other than JSON, like binary. Reusing the JWT payload structure and claims, limits the Notary JWS envelope to only support JSON payload, which is undesirable. Also, reusing JWT claims requires following same claim semantics as defined in JWT specifications. The [`exp`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-4.1.4) claim requires that verifier MUST reject the signature if current time equals or is greater than `exp`, where as Notary allows verification policy to define how expiry is handled.

## Signature specification

**Q: How will Notary support multiple signature envelope formats?**

**A:** The `mediaType` of artifact manifest's blob identifies the signature envelope type.  
The client implementation can use the aforementioned `mediaType` to parse the signature envelope.

**Q: How will Notary support multiple payload formats?**

**A:** The Signature envelope MUST have a versioning mechanism to support multiple payload formats.
For [JWS JSON serialization](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject/blob/main/specs/signature-envelope-jws.md) signature envelope, versioning is achieved by the `cty` field in ProtectedHeaders.


## Signature scheme

**Q: What is the relationship of Signing Scheme with Signature Envelope format?**

**A:** Signing Scheme aims to be agnostic of the Signature Envelope format.
A given signing scheme can be implemented through any signature envelope format (such as JWS or COSE) as long as it can support the required signature schema used by the signing scheme.

**Q: Why is the trust store used for Signing Authority (`x509/signingAuthority`) distinct from trust store for Certificate Authority (`x509/ca`), why canâ€™t they share the same trust store?**

**A:** Signing Authority is a different type of trusted entity as compared to Certificate Authority (CA) or Timestamping Authority (TSA).
A CA is trusted for verifying the identity of a signing entity (end user) and issuing it a certificate, whereas a TSA is trusted to generate authentic timestamp.
In contrast, an SA is trusted to generate signatures on behalf of an end user (signature requestor) and also to generate authentic timestamp as part of the signature.
If we use a shared trust store for CA and SA, a verifying entity does not have the ability to differentiate between CA and SA when the verifying entity configures trusted roots in the trust store.
This has implication such as an end user with CA issued certificate can masquerade themselves as an SA by generating a signature with signing scheme `notary.x509.signingAuthority`.

## Trust store and trust policy

**Q: Does Notary supports `n` out of `m` signatures verification requirement?**

**A:** Notary doesn't support n out m signature requirement verification scheme.
Signature verification workflow succeeds if verification succeeds for at least one signature.

**Q: Does Notary support overriding of revocation endpoints to support signature verification in disconnected environments?**

**A:** TODO: Update after verification extensibility spec is ready.
Not natively supported but a user can configure `revocationValidations` to `skip` and then use extended validations to check for revocation.

**Q: Why user needs to include a complete certificate chain (leading to root) in the signature?**

**A:** Without a complete certificate chain, the implementation won't be able to perform an exhaustive revocation check, which will lead to security issues, and that's the reason for enforcing a complete certificate chain.

**Q: Why are we validating artifact signature first instead of signing identity?**

**A:** Ideally, we should validate the signing identity first and then use the public key in the signing identity to validate the artifact signature.
However, this will lead to poor performance in the case where the signature is not valid as there are lots of validations against the signing identity including network calls for revocations, and possibly we won't even need to read the trust store/trust policy if the signature validation fails.
Also, by validating artifact signature first we will still fail the validation if the signing identity is not trusted.

## Notary Project Terms

**Q: What is Notary Project?**

**A:** The Notary Project is the [GitHub organization](https://github.com/notaryproject), the community, all specifications, and all repositories within the Notary Project, including community-released tools like [notary](https://github.com/notaryproject/notary) and [notation](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation).

**Q: How are Notary and Notary Project related?**

**A:** Notary, a tool for artifact signing based on The Update Framework (TUF), is developed by the Notary Project community and is hosted within the Notary Project's GitHub organization. So, notary is a tool, and Notary Project is the community that developed and maintains it.

**Q: What is the difference between Notary Project and TUF?**

**A:** The Notary Project, as a [GitHub organization](https://github.com/notaryproject), host multiple repositories including a [TUF](https://github.com/notaryproject/tuf) repository, which is a specific repository intended for prototyping the storage of TUF metadata in OCI-compliant registries.

**Q: What is Notary Project specification?**

**A:** Notary Project Specifications, mainly created between years 2021-2022, are a collection of specifications distributed across "subprojects" within the Notary Project. Notation CLI and libraries have implemented these specifications, which are also utilized by other OSS projects and/or vendor tools that seek to interoperate with the Notary Project tooling.

**Q: What is the difference between Notary and Notation?**

**A:** Notary and Notation are both solutions for signing artifacts. The main difference between these two tools is that notary is based on [The Update Framework](https://theupdateframework.com) (TUF) specification while Notation is non-TUF-based. While notary has server and client components, Notation has a CLI and libraries. An example of a notary implementation is Docker Content Trust (DCT). In addition to signing artifacts, Notation handles artifact verification, signature portability, and integration with third-party key management solutions via a plugin model.

**Q: I've heard the term "Notary v2". What does this mean?**

**A:** The term "notary v2" was previously used by the Notary Project and others. However, various meanings were ascribed to it, leading to its ambiguous usage with some people referring to it as the entire Notary Project and others as the Notation CLI. Because of this ambiguity, the term "notary v2" is no longer used by the Notary Project. While the term may still be visible in some articles on the internet, the name "notary v2" is no longer valid.
